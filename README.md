## Project Neighborhood Map
#### Edinburgh Attractions

***
This is project 5 for the [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) Full Stack Nanodegree. 
The aim of the project is to develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood.
I picked a project that lists attractions in Edinburgh, OR and pulls information from FourSquare.
